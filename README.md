# jiractl

A command-line tool for managing Jira.

## Install

```
npm i @godaddy/jiractl --global
```

Optionally enable autocomplete:

```
jiractl install-completion
```

## Setup

Add a context for the Jira instance that you use. E.g:

```console
$ jiractl config set-context https://jira.yourteam.com
Username: name
Password:
Context "https://jira.yourteam.com" created.
Set default context to "https://jira.yourteam.com".
```

Add the teams in your project. E.g., for a project named FOO:
```
jiractl setup FOO
```
This will output the team names added.

Some team names are difficult to type or remember on the command line; to alias a team that you use frequently, run:
```
jiractl alias [name] [alias]
```

e.g.
```console
$ jiractl alias "Orange Cats" cats

```
Outputs:
```
Aliased Orange Cats with cats:
 { board: 1234,
   name: 'Orange Cats',
   epicFilter: [ epicFilter ] }
```
You can then run jiractl commands using `cats` as the team name.

## Example usage

```
jiractl --team=cats [action] [context]
```
